# The-COVID-19-News-Topic-Evolution-Analysis

Considering the current situation of COVID-19 in 2020, we applied LDA to explore the news topics evolution from January 10 to March 31. To complete the task, we firstly crawl the dataset and do some cleaning, and then used several methods to choose the important parameters which LDA needs. We also propose a new intensity calculation method. Finally, we drew the evolution path of topics of all news according to our new intensity calculation method.
